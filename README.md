## General Information
### Installation
- Drop the .dll into `/%ScheduleOne Install%/Mods/`.
- Delete to uninstall.
### Features
- Packagers will use routes from storages and equipment to loading dock vehicles.
- The main branch (Il2Cpp) version allows each dock to be set to Load only, Unload only, or Dual (default).
- Alternate (Mono) version only has on / off setting.
- Be careful when using Dual / On setting, that two Packagers don't get stuck in a loop together.
- Obeys item filters, stack size, and other normal mechanics.
